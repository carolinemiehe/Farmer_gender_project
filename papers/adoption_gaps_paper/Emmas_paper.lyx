\begin_layout Abstract
This study examines gender differences in maize productivity and maize income in Eastern Uganda,
 with particular attention to the role of improved seed adoption.
 Focusing on male and female headed households in the Busoga region,
 the analysis employs a mixed-methods approach,
 combining quantitative and qualitative evidence.
 First,
 ordinary least squares (OLS) models are estimated to descriptively examine gender gaps across outcomes..
 Both baseline and pooled panel data are used,
 covering baseline,
 midline and endline survey rounds,
 allowing gender gaps to be assessed both cross-sectionally and over time.
 Following that,
 the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition tecnique is employed at baseline to decompose gender gaps in productivity,
 and income into differences in endowments and differences in returns to those endowments.
 To further examine the role of technology adoption,
 an instrumental variables (IV) approach is implemented to estimate the causal impact of improved seed adoption on maize productivity and income.
 Qualitative analysis and focus group discussions complement econometric analysis by giving contextual information about gendered dynamics in maize production in Busoga region.
 The study advances the literature by giving new context-specific evidence on potential gender-differentiated outcomes in smallholder maize farming,
 with particular attention to the role of hybrid seed varieties adoption as a key driver of agricultural performance.
 The findings provide policy-relevant insights for promoting more equitable productivity and income outcomes in maize production in Eastern Uganda.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In sub-Saharan Africa,
 agriculture remains a key driver of economic activity and a primary source of employment,
 particularly in rural areas.
 In Uganda the population is predominantly rural and it substantially relies on agriculture (World Bank Development Indicators,
 2013).
 The following analysis focuses on the cultivation of maize,
 one of the most important staple crops in Ugandan agriculture.
 Maize is cultivated by the majority of rural households in East Africa,
 making the Ugandan experience broadly comparable to that of other African countries (Sell et al.,
 2018).
 Previous research suggests that climate change is expected to have a significant negative effect on maize production in Uganda,
 with projected yield losses of around 5% by 2050 (Kikoyo & Norbert,
 2016,
 as cited in Sell et al.,
 2018).
 In an agricultural context with such constraints and challenges where increasing yields through cultivated area is not possible,
 identifying strategies to enhance agricultural production,
 and consequently income,
 becomes essential for poverty reduction and food security.
 Despite that,
 progress has remained stubbornly slow,
 with productivity growth lagging well behind other regions (Suri & Udry,
 2022).
 This is the reason why increasing agricultural productivity and raising incomes of rural households is one of the goals of Uganda's Agriculture Sector Development Strategy and Investment Plan (DSIP),
 which aims to improve food security and nutrition for all Ugandans (De La O Campos et al.,
 2015).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most persistent and costly inefficiencies is the gender gap in agricultural productivity (Buehren,
 2023).
 While women constitute a substantial share of the agricultural labor force in Sub-Saharan Africa – over 50% Tanzania,
 Uganda and Malawi (Palacios-Lopez et al.,
 2016) – they consistently achieve lower yields than men and the income they get is substantially lower than the one earned by male farmers (FAO,
 2011).
 A large body of literature shows that women in agriculture face persistent institutional and structural constraints,
 including a limited access to land and productive inputs,
 markets,
 credit and labour,
 as well as time constraints linked to household and care-giving responsibilities,
 that prevent them from achieving productivity levels comparable to those of men (all the sources).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agricultural income is also not distributed evenly.
 Despite income discrimination differing geographically,
 female-headed households remain among the poorest of the poor (Djurfeldt,
 2013).
 The literature shows that discriminatory barriers,
 lower output prices,
 and unequal access to credit contribute to enhancing gender gaps in income from farm activities (sources).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another key constraint for agricultural productivity and income is the widespread under-adoption of modern agricultural technologies,
 such as improved seed varieties,
 fertilizers and pesticides (Suri & Udry,
 2022).
 Despite input mechanization expanding especially in maize production (Williamson,
 2008),
 male-headed households are more likely to use modern inputs (Sheahan & Barrett,
 year;
 Peterman,
 2010).
 However,
 existing evidence suggests that lower adoption rates among female farmers are often driven not by a lower willingness to adopt,
 but by differential access to the information and resources required to use these technologies effectively.
 Therefore,
 understanding adoption is central not only as a determinant of productivity and income,
 but also as a potential channel through which gender gaps emerge and persist.
 Gender disparities in agricultural productivity and income are costly and they represent a lost chance to increase national income and alleviate poverty (Buheren,
 2023).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first objective of this paper is to contribute to the bulk of evidence on gender differentials in agricultural maize productivity,
 gross income,
 and adoption of improved seeds variety by analyzing context-specific household-level data from the Busoga region,
 in Eastern Uganda.
 The paper mainly relies on panel data from three survey rounds with approximately 3,500 smallholder maize farmers in southeastern Uganda.
 We estimate baseline OLS models and apply Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition to assess the relative contribution of differences in endowments versus structural differences in returns to these endowments.
 The analysis also examines the adoption of improved maize seed varieties,
 considering it both as an outcome of interest and as a key mechanism that could influence productivity and income disparities among households.
 To address the potential endogeneity of adoption decisions,
 an instrumental variables (IV) strategy was implemented to estimate the causal impact of adopting improved seeds on maize productivity and income.
 In parallel,
 we conducted a qualitative analysis consisting of 16 focus group discussions with smallholder farmers in the same region.
 This mixed-methods approach allows for data triangulation and provide a more comprehensive understanding of gendered constraints in agricultural production.
 By jointly examining the descriptive outcomes and the causal components,
 the paper provides policy-relevant evidence on the mechanisms through which gender gaps in smallholder maize systems persist.
 Understanding and addressing these gender-differentiated constraints is essential for achieving inclusive agricultural transformation,
 improving well-being and food security.
 The paper is structured as follows.
 Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and outlines the key contributions to the study of gender differentials in agricultural production.
 Section 3 describes the data sources,
 including both the quantitative household-level dataset and the qualitative fieldwork.
 Section 4 presents the methodological approach,
 detailing the empirical strategy,
 including the OLS regressions,
 the Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition,
 and the causal specification.
 The results,
 both quantitative and qualitative are presented in section 5 and discussed in section 6.
 The last sections concludes the study.

Literature Review 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While women constitute a substantial share of the agricultural labor force in Sub-Saharan Africa – over 50% Tanzania,
 Uganda and Malawi (Palacios-Lopez et al.,
 2017) – they consistently achieve lower yields than men and the income they get is substantially lower than the one earned by male farmers (FAO,
 2011).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper contributes to the literature on gender gaps in the agricultural sector (many sources + De,
 Miehe,
 and Van Campenhout,
 2024).
 Building on the intra-household approach,
 after estimating the gap through descriptive statistics and OLS regressions,
 we advance the literature that disentangles the roles of endowment versus structural effects in driving gender disparities.
 Women face two broad types of constraints:
 limited access to assets and productive inputs (endowment effect) and discriminatory social norms and practices that reduce returns to those inputs (structural effect).
 The most common approach to analyzing such gaps is the Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition of mean differences,
 a well-established empirical strategy in labor economics,
 originally developed by Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973).
 Kilic,
 Palacios-Lopez,
 and Goldstein (2015) were the first to apply this approach to the analysis of agricultural productivity and a growing number of studies followed (Palacios-Lopez and Lopez,
 2015;
 Slavchevska ,
 2015;
 Ali et al.,
 2016;
 and De la O Campos et al.,
 2016) .
 Building on this framework,
 we employ the Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition to examine gender gaps in both agricultural productivity and farming gross income.
 The existing literature indicates that both endowments and structural mechanisms play a role in shaping the observed gaps in agricultural productivity and income (Buheren,
 2023).
 With respect to the productivity gap,
 multiple studies show that once differences in access to productive inputs are accounted for,
 the estimated gap substantially narrow (Gilbert et al.,
 2002;
 Kinkingninhoun-Mêdagbé et al.,
 2010;
 Kilic et al.,
 2015;
 Peterman et al.,
 2011,
 De la O Campos et al.,
 2016),
 highlighting the key importance of access to inputs in observed yields differentials.
 For example,
 De la O Campos et al.
 (2016) demonstrate that the gender gap in agricultural productivity in Uganda diminishes once differences in access to production factors—
such as fertilizers and pesticides—
as well as crop choice are taken into account.
 In this regard,
 also Kilic et al.
 (2015) suggest that disparities in asset ownership,
 such as machinery and new technology,
 substantially contribute to the gender gap in productivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 other studies find that productivity and income gaps persist even after equalizing input access,
 pointing to structural constraints,
 resource allocation and returns to inputs as the main problems (Ali et al.,
 2016 ;
 Bello et al.,
 2021;
 O’Sullivan et al.,
 2014;
 Kinkingninhoun-Medagb´e et al.,
 2010;
 Dandonougbo et al.
 2023;
 Palacios-Lopez ´ and Lopez ´,
 2015).
 Several studies have shown that child dependency ratio,
 social expectation and time poverty play a key role in shaping these differences (Ali et al.,
 2016;
 Sell et al.,
 2018;
 Pierotti et al.,
 2022;
 Donald et al.,
 2023).
 According to Sell et al.,
 (20218),
 women’s lower level of productivity is negatively associated with the number of household members.
 Time constraints may be more binding for women as a great proportion of their time is devoted to mansions that do not generate an income,
 such as childcare,
 elderly care and food preparation and prevent them from engaging in agricultural activities (Buheren,
 2023 & Pierotti et al,
 2022).
 In Uganda,
 for example,
 evidence shows that two fifths of the gender gap are explained by unequal returns to the child dependency ratio (Ali et al.,
 2016).
 Evidence from the literature also suggests that social norms and expectations in market orientation and risk preferences could explain the gender gap in productivity (Ali et al,
 2016;
 Duflo & Udry,
 2004;
 Reynolds et al.,
 2020).
 Women usually place lower value on cash crops,
 overlooking income potential and high market prices,
 while favoring food security (Duflo,
 Udry,
 2004).
 Other factors that might explain the gender gap in productivity and income from maize are access to labour and credit market (Kilic,
 Palacios-Lopez & Goldstein,
 2015;
 Palacios-Lopez & Lopez,
 2015;
 Ali et al.,
 2016;).
 Palacios-Lopez and Lopez (2015) claim that correcting market failures could positively impact female farmers’ productivity.
 Several studies identify discrimination in the labor market and off-farm work as drivers of low labor productivity in plots managed by female-headed households (Palacios-Lopez ´ and Lopez ´,
 2015;
 Julien et al.,2023).
 Limited access to finance further constrains women’s ability to adopt modern technologies,
 machinery,
 and improved agricultural practices,
 reinforcing existing productivity and income disparities (Buheren,
 2023).
 Technology adoption represents one of the main channels through which differences in access to inputs translate into productivity and income disparities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although these contributions provide a meaningful overview,
 context-specific analysis is required to effectively guide policy recommendations.
 We extend this body of work by estimating gender gaps in agricultural productivity and income from maize in male and female headed households using plot-level data from the Busoga region of Uganda for 2021–2022.
 Gender gap in agricultural productivity,
 particularly in maize production,
 usually translates into a gender gap in income,
 as documented by Buehren (2023),
 thereby reinforcing processes of feminization of poverty.
 However,
 while gender disparities in agricultural productivity have been extensively studied,
 evidence on gendered income differentials from farming in Africa remains limited and fragmented (Mkuna & Wale,
 2023),
 especially in maize production in Uganda.
 Mkuna and Wale (2023) records gender income gap of approximately 50% in cabbage farmers in South Africa.
 Previous research suggests that the average agricultural farm income gap observed between men and women is about 66% in Togo rural areas (Dandonougbo et al.,
 2023).
 Through a study in Benin on rice production,
 Kinkingninhoun-Medagbe et al.
 (2008) show that the average income of men is more than four times that of women.
 According to them improving land will have positive effects on income and more in general to gender equity.
 The literature shows that prevailing cultural norms and local systems of land access often disadvantage women,
 who rarely inherit land and instead cultivate plots borrowed from husbands or relatives,
 frequently consisting of smaller and lower-quality parcels;
 this pattern of gender-based marginalization in land allocation,
 both in terms of quantity and quality,
 has been widely documented in Sub-Saharan Africa (Basile,
 2001;
 Dey Abbas,
 1997;
 Saito et al.,
 1994;
 Palmer,
 1991;
 Lubbock,
 1988).
 Mkuna &Wale (2023),
 documented a 92% of endowment component in the observed income gender gap between smallholder irrigation farmers in South Africa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While decomposition methods identify the relative contribution of observable characteristics and structural differences,
 they do not establish causal relationships between technology adoption and agricultural outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After presenting descriptive evidence,
 the paper examines the causal relationship between the adoption of improved maize seed varieties and both maize productivity and gross farm income using an instrumental variables (IV) approach.
 Existing research on gender inequalities in access to agricultural technologies has largely focused on inorganic fertilizers (Peterman,
 2010),
 while evidence on improved seed adoption remains less conclusive.
 Doss and Morris (2001) find that once access to complementary inputs is taken into account,
 differences in adoption rates between male and female farmers largely disappear.
 In contrast,
 other studies argue that male farmers remain more likely to adopt improved seed varieties due to better access to markets,
 information,
 and commercialization opportunities (Sanginga et al.,
 2007;
 Tiruneh et al.,
 2001).
 These dynamics unfold within a broader process of agricultural modernization,
 where technological change and mechanization have expanded particularly in maize production systems,
 increasing the importance of input adoption as a pathway to productivity growth (Williamson et al.,
 2008).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Importantly,
 even when men and women have access to similar modern inputs,
 evidence suggests that women often obtain lower returns from their use.
 Djurfeldt (2013) argues that the benefits of technology adoption depend not only on access to inputs but also on the ability to integrate production into markets,
 highlighting the role of commercialization in translating productivity gains into higher income.
 Persistent weaknesses in agricultural credit markets further constrain this process,
 limiting farmers’ ability to finance improved inputs and complementary investments necessary to fully benefit from new technologies (Sheahan & Barrett,
 2017).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper contributes to this literature by extending the analysis of gender gaps beyond productivity alone and jointly examining adoption,
 productivity,
 and gross income outcomes.
 By combining causal estimation with decomposition methods,
 the study provides new evidence on the mechanisms through which gender disparities in smallholder maize systems arise and persist,
 and on the extent to which technology adoption can contribute to narrowing these gaps.

\begin_layout Section
Data and Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantitative Data 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paper uses panel data from three survey rounds with approximately 3,500 smallholder maize farmers in southeastern Uganda.
 The data were originally collected for a previous project focused on agro-dealers and their customers(source).
 The agro-dealer sample was constructed by listing all agro-dealers operating across eleven districts in the Busoga region,
 an area characterized by smallholder maize production,
 where maize serves both as a staple food and a cash crop.
 To link agro-dealers with farmers,
 each agro-dealer was asked to identify the villages where most of their customers reside.
 Enumerators then randomly sampled ten maize-growing households from each of these villages,
 yielding the sample of 3,470 farmers.
 This sampling frame allows us to assume that sampled farmers have reasonable access to improved maize varieties,
 should they choose to adopt them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enumerators interviewed the household member most knowledgeable about maize cultivation.
 A subset of questions specifically targeted the household head,
 who may or may not have been the respondent.
 In addition to general information on agricultural practices,
 farmers were asked to list all their maize plots,
 from which one was randomly selected for detailed data collection.
 This approach minimized survey duration and respondent burden while preserving representativeness at the household level,
 due to the random selection of plots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Baseline data were collected in April 2021,
 followed by midline surveys in January-February 2022 and endline surveys in July-August 2022.
 Of the 3,470 farmers interviewed at baseline,
 3,407 were re-interviewed at midline and 3,441 at endline.
 In our case,
 plot-level measures of soil quality and others are missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Descriptive statistics and Measurement of Key Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis focuses on three main outcome variables:
 agricultural productivity,
 income from maize and the adoption of improved maize seed varieties.
 All variables are measured on the randomly selected plot.
 Agricultural productivity is measured as maize yield per unit of cultivated land,
 capturing differences in output across plots.
 Maize income is measured as the gross value of maize sales,
 expressed in Ugandan shillings.
 For households that did not sell maize,
 income is set to zero.
 For households that reported selling maize,
 income is calculated as the quantity sold multiplied by the unit price received.
 Observations with missing information on sold quantities or bag prices among sellers are left as missing.
 The estimated decomposition reflects differences in both market participation and conditional revenue,
 as zero income observations represent non-participation in maize sales.
 Adoption of improved seed varieties is calculated using a binary indicator equal to one if the farmer planted a hybrid maize variety during the reference season,
 and zero otherwise.
 This variable captures the uptake of improved seed technology at the farm level.
 Hybrid seed adoption is measured as a binary indicator equal to one if the household reports using one of the officially recognized hybrid maize varieties (Longe 10H,
 Longe 7H,
 Longe 7R Kayongo-go,
 Bazooka,
 Longe 6H,
 Panner,
 Wema,
 or KH series),
 and zero otherwise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the skewed distribution and the presence of zero values in the outcome variables,
 maize productivity and gross income are transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformation in the empirical analysis.
 .
 Skewness is according to the adjusted Fisher-Pearson coefficient of skewness exceeding 1.96.
 To address the recent critiques by Mullahy and Norton (2022) and Chen and Roth (2024),
 we will apply the IHS transformation cautiously when dealing with outcome variables that have many zeros and impacts on the extensive margin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the descriptive statistics (Table 1) we observe significant differences in maize productivity,
 income from maize sales and hybrid seed adoption between male and female headed households.
 Productivity is higher for male-headed households,
 both in standard units (kg/acre) and when using the IHS transformation.
 Similarly,
 income from maize sales shows a statistically significant difference in levels and IHS terms,
 favouring male-headed households.
 Overall,
 the table provides a descriptive overview of household-level characteristics and plot-level characteristics recorded at baseline for both groups.

Quantiative Data Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assessment of gender gaps in agriculture generally relies on two different empirical approaches and indicators that significantly influence the analysis of gender differences (De la O Campos et al.,
 2015).
 This paper makes use of inter-household analyses,
 which compare agricultural production in male and female headed households,
 using household headship as a proxy for plot management.
\begin_inset Note Comment
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(is it a proxy?
 Is it ok to put it in limitations?)
\end_layout

\end_inset

The second approach adopts an intra-household perspective,
 comparing production on female and male managed plots within the same household,
 allowing household characteristics to be held constant.
 As mentioned by Ali et al.
 (2016),
 since most female-managed plots are located within male-headed households,
 the first approach may draw inferences from a non-representative subset of women farmers and misclassify plots by gender.
 The use of household headship is further problematic because it does not capture who makes agricultural decisions or controls productive assets,
 nor does it account for intra-household power dynamics that shape resource allocation (Doss,
 2001;
 Udry,
 1996;
 Quisumbing & Maluccio,
 2003).
 Despite that,
 this approach requires more detailed data and may face limitations in sample size and external validity.
 In this study,
 the use of an inter-household approach is driven by data availability,
 as gender information was collected at the level of the household head,
 making intra-household quantitative analysis infeasible.
 Nevertheless,
 this limitation is partly addressed through qualitative data,
 which provide insights into intra-household decision-making processes and power relations and complement the inter-household quantitative analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paper can rely on relatively few female-headed households,
 which limits statistical power of the analysis.
 At baseline,
 we recorded the gender of the household head,
 identifying 774 female-headed households (22% of 3,470 farmers).
 At the endline,
 we recorded 760 female household heads (23% of 3,299).
 No information on the gender of the household head was collected at the midline stage;
 however,
 it is unlikely that there were any substantial changes during this period.
 Therefore,
 for the midline analysis,
 the gender classification observed at baseline and endline was assumed to remain unchanged.
 These limitations represent a weakness of the study.

Qualitative Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The qualitative component of the data is based on fieldwork conducted in the Busoga region in south-east Uganda.
 Taking place over approximately 15 days between November and December 2025,
 the fieldwork covered several villages in the districts of Iganga,
 Bugweri,
 Bugiri and Mayuge.
 Sixteen focus group discussions (FGDs) were held,
 each with 10 participants (160 participants in total).
 The composition of the groups was defined to capture specific gender perspectives,
 therefore 5 FGDs were women-only,
 5 were men-only,
 and 6 were mixed.
 The single-gender groups were used to encourage the participants to freely express experiences and opinions by reducing possible effects of bias and power asymmetries that can arise in mixed contexts.
 On the other hand,
 mixed groups allowed us to observe how intra-family norms and roles are reproduced in the discussion.
 Participants were selected randomly,
 ensuring a range of ages,
 with all participants being adults.
 All the people selected were plot managers,
 but not necessarily the household head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discussions were guided by a semi-structured outline consisting mainly of open-ended questions,
 probes and follow-ups.
 Moreover,
 to stimulate an open and participatory discussion,
 participants were encouraged to reflect on concrete examples and real-life situations.
 The questions (provided in Appendix X) covered topics related to gender norms,
 the division of labour and time use,
 economic empowerment,
 decision-making processes,
 power dynamics within the households,
 the adoption of new technology,
 and market access.
 All FGDs were conducted in Lusoga language by two enumerators and lasted an average of about two hours.
 In all of them it was ensured privacy and confidentiality;
 in particular,
 women and male partners/counterparts were not involved in the same session as this could compromise safety or freedom of expression.
 The qualitative work aimed to contextualize the quantitative results and explore underlying social mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Qualitative Data limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FGDs were conducted in Lusoga and later translated.
 Therefore,
 nuances,
 humor,
 and culturally embedded meanings can be lost or reshaped through translation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The enumerator's male gender may have limited openness in women-only groups,
 particularly on themes like home conflict,
 threats,
 and sexual duties.
 The occasional presence of local leaders (e.g.,
 chairperson) can further influence answers toward "community-approved" narratives and diminish participants' willingness to criticize norms.
 Although qualitative findings help explain reasons why disparities may persist,
 there is no direct correlation between specific FGD participants and survey households.
 Thus,
 triangulation is conceptual rather than individual-level causal inference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover,
 the qualitative findings are highly context-specific,
 including gender norms,
 labor arrangements,
 and market interactions unique to the Busoga region in Eastern Uganda.
 Nevertheless,
 the revealed mechanisms may help us to understand gender-based restrictions in similar rural settings,
 assuming that contextual differences are carefully recognised.
 (These limitations suggest that the results should be interpreted as descriptive evidence of gender disparities associated with household headship,
 supported by qualitative insights,
 rather than causal estimates of gender discrimination.)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis focuses on the three main outcome described in detailed section 3.
 Gender gaps in maize productivity,
 gross income from maize and adoption of hybrid seeds varieties are first estimated using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions.
 The baseline specification relates to a simple yield function (Udry,
 1996) in the form:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{ht}=\alpha+\beta X_{ij}+\gamma G_{h}+\varepsilon_{ij}\label{eq:one-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where Yh denotes the outcome of interest for household h measured alternatively as maize productivity,
 income from maize or adoption of hybrid seeds.
 While previous studies model productivity outcomes in logarithmic form (e.g.
 Udry,
 1996),
 we employ the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation to accommodate zero productivity and income observations.
 When considering the adoption of hybrid seed as outcome variable,
 the OLS specification corresponds to a Linear Probability Model (LPM).
 While nonlinear models such as logit or probit are often used for binary outcomes,
 the LPM provides a straightforward interpretation and facilitates comparison with the continuous outcomes analyzed in this study.
 However,
 the LPM suffer several problems but the main disadvantage is that the predicted value could fall outside the zero-to-one probability values (Gujarai,
 1988).
 Robustness checks using logit specifications that follow logistic cumulative distribution are reported in Appendix X and present similar results logit used by ( Banerjee and Martin,
 2009;
 Aneani et al.,
 2012;
 Challa and Tilahun,2014;
 Dhraief et al.,
 2018;
 Murtaza et al.,
 2020).
 Using the LPM in section 5 coefficients are interpreted as percentage-point changes in the probability of adoption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gh is a binary indicator equal to one if the household head is male and zero otherwise.
 The coefficient β captures the conditional difference in the outcome of interest (or,
 in the case of adoption,
 in the probability of adoption) between male- and female-headed households.
 The vector X includes a set of control variables commonly used in the literature on gender gaps in agricultural outcomes (Kinkingninhoun-Mêdagbé et al.,
 2010;
 Palacios-López & López,
 2015;
 Peterman et al.
 2010,
 Peterman et al.,
 2011;
 Wayagi et al.,
 2025).
 These controls account for differences in household socio-economic characteristics,
 farm size and input use,
 labor availability,
 and access to markets and agricultural services.
 Due to data limitations,
 the analysis does not include detailed agro-climatic and soil quality indicators,
 such as rainfall variability or irrigation intensity,
 which may also affect agricultural outcomes.
 The error term εh captures unobserved factors affecting agricultural outcomes.
 The full set of covariates and the corresponding regression specifications are reported in Tables 2 and 3 in the Results section.
 (Some variables reported in the descriptive statistics are excluded from the regression analysis either because they are highly collinear with included covariates or because they could create problems of endogeneity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to cross-section specifications based solely on the baseline sample,
 pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions are estimated by combining baseline,
 midline and endline observations into a single household-level panel dataset.
 Using pooled sample increases the statistical power of the analysis and allows us to verify whether gender differences in agricultural outcomes persist over time once the observable characteristics of households and agricultural activity have been controlled for.
 .
 In the pooled specification,
 the model takes the form:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{ht}=\alpha+\beta X_{ij}+\gamma G_{h}+\delta_{t}+\varepsilon_{ij}\label{eq:one-1-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 𝑡 denotes the survey round and 𝛿𝑡 represents survey-round fixed effects that capture time-specific factors affecting all households simultaneously,
 such as seasonal conditions,
 price fluctuations,
 or other aggregate shocks.
 Including fixed round effects therefore enables comparisons to be made between male and female households within the same period,
 preventing average differences between rounds from being mistakenly attributed to gender.
 Fixed effects at the household level are not included in the analysis:
 these effects would absorb all the characteristics of the household that remain unchanged over time,
 including the gender variable.
 (see Ali et al.
 that includes it).
 Some covariates collected at baseline were not re-measured in the midline and endline surveys.
 These variables capture household characteristics,
 which we assume remain constant over the study period.
 Accordingly,
 baseline values are carried forward in the pooled panel analysis.
 (These include education level,
 household size,
 age of the household head,
 distance to the nearest agro-input shop,
 and the number of agro-input shops in the village).
 As stated before,
 no information on the gender of the household head was collected at the midline stage;
 however,
 it is unlikely that there were any substantial changes during this period.
 Therefore,
 for the midline analysis,
 the gender classification observed at baseline and endline was assumed to remain unchanged.

\begin_layout Subsection
Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate the sources of gender disparities in productivity and income,
 we apply the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (Blinder,
 1973;
 Oaxaca,
 1973).
 The OLS regressions described provide the basis for the decomposition methods.
 This method decomposes observed gender gaps into two components:
 the endowment effect and the structural effect.
 The endowment effect captures differences due to observable farmer and farm-household characteristics,
 such as access to land,
 credit,
 education,
 and inputs.
 These are factors that reflect unequal resource access.
 The structural effect accounts for differences in returns to those resources,
 potentially reflecting discriminatory social norms or practices.
 The Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition therefore quantifies the contribution of observable characteristics commonly available in household survey data while acknowledging that unobserved data not computed in the equation,
 such as agro-ecological conditions may remain captured in the returns component (source).
 Based on the work of Kilic et al.
 (2015),
 we derived the average gap between men and women "D",
 expressed as the average difference in productivity and income:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D=E(Y_{m})-E(Y_{f})\label{eq:one-1-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{f}$
\end_inset

 denote the expected outcomes for male and female headed households,
 obtained from linear estimation of agricultural productivity and income expressed in inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation (1) relies on the restrictive assumption that the returns to observable characteristics are identical for male and female headed households.
 To relax this assumption,
 we follow standard practice in the literature and estimate separate linear regressions for each group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expected outcome of the separate/gender-specific regressions can be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E(Y_{m})=\alpha_{m}+\beta_{m}E(X_{m})\label{eq:one-1-1-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E(Y_{f})=\alpha_{f}+\beta_{f}E(X_{f})\label{eq:one-1-1-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\lang american
Where X denotes a vector of observable household and farm characteristics,
 and 𝛽𝑚 and 𝛽𝑓 represent the associated vectors of coefficients for male and female headed households,
 respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By substituting these expressions into the definition of D,
 the overall gender gap can be expressed as a function of disparities in observable characteristics as well as differences in the returns to those characteristics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain an aggregate decomposition,
 we follow the threefold Oaxaca–Blinder.
 To construct the counterfactual non-discriminatory structure,
 we use the coefficients from a pooled regression estimated on the combined sample of male- and female-headed households (Jann,
 2008).
 This approach,
 commonly adopted in the agricultural gender gap literature,
 avoids privileging either group’s returns structure as the benchmark and instead relies on the average returns observed in the overall production environment,
 under the assumption that male and female farmers operate within a similar agricultural system and production function.
 As a robustness check decompositions with male structure and female structure as benchmark are reported in Appendix X.

\begin_layout Standard
The explained component captures the portion of the gender gap attributable to differences in observable endowments,
 such as land,
 fertilizer use and access to inputs.
 Formally,
 this corresponds to the first term of the decomposition and aggregates the contributions across all covariates 𝑘.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unexplained component reflects differences in returns to observables endowments.
 In the threefold specification adopted here,
 this component is further divided into a male structural advantage term,
 and a female structural disadvantage term,
 which respectively measure how male and female returns deviate from the pooled benchmark.
 Not only it captures potential structural contraints but also the influence of unobserved heterogeneity,
 measurement error,
 and omitted variables,
 such as land quality or agro-ecological conditions.
 Therefore,
 the structural component should be interpreted cautiously as reflecting differential returns rather than direct evidence of discrimination.

Standard errors are estimated (using 300 bootstrap) replications with resampling performed within gender groups.
 All outcomes are expressed in inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) units,
 which allows coefficients and gaps to be interpreted approximately as percentage differences.
 The results are presented in Table 5 and discussed in Section 5.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Empirical Issues 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Oaxaca Blinder decomposition relies on a set of identifying assumptions (Fortin et al.,
 2011).
 The aggregate decomposition is valid under the assumption of overlapping support,
 which requires sufficient similarity in the distribution of observable characteristics across male and female headed households.
 This condition was carefully assessed by inspecting the distribution of key covariates across male and female headed households.
 The Kernel density plots (reported in Appendix X) indicate substantial overlap in the main covariates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The credibility of the decomposition also relies on the plausibility of the ignorability assumption,
 which requires that,
 conditional on the observed covariates,
 the gender of the household head is not correlated with unobserved factors affecting productivity and income.
 While this assumption cannot be directly tested,
 we mitigate concerns of omitted variable bias by incorporating a rich set of controls,
 thereby reducing concerns related to omitted variable bias.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The detailed decomposition additionally relies on the assumptions of additive linearity and zero conditional mean (Fortin et al.,
 2011).
 Additive linearity assumes that the outcome can be expressed as a linear combination of observed covariates,
 with each variable contributing independently and additively to the conditional mean of the outcome.
 The zero conditional mean assumption requires that the error term is not systematically correlated with the included covariates.
 While this assumption cannot be tested directly,
 the specification incorporates a rich set of household- and plot-level characteristics widely used in the literature (Kinkingninhoun-Mêdagbé et al.,
 2010;
 Palacios-López & López,
 2015;
 Peterman et al.
 2010,
 Peterman et al.,
 2011;
 Wayagi et al.,
 2025) thereby reducing the scope for omitted variable bias.
 To increase the likelihood that zero conditional mean holds,
 some studies introduce panel-data methods to the O–B decomposition of the gender gap in agricultural productivity to account for unobserved characteristics (Slavchevska,
 2015;
 Ali et al.,
 2016).
 Given the time-invariant nature of gender,
 they are not applicable in the present setting.
 To partially mitigate concerns related to unobserved heterogeneity,
 the analysis implements round fixed effects,
 and conducts robustness checks across alternative specifications and sample restrictions.
 controls.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally,
 reverse causality is unlikely to pose a major concern in this setting,
 as input decisions precede harvest and revenue realization within the agricultural production cycle.
 Inputs can therefore be reasonably treated as predetermined with respect to observed income outcomes (Griliches,
 1963;
 Dinar,
 Karagiannis,
 & Tzouvelekas,
 2007).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since decomposition techniques rely on correlations,
 they cannot be understood as estimates of causal parameters (Fortin,
 Lemieux,
 & Firpo,
 2011).
 However,
 these methods can record the relative quantitative significance of components in explaining an observed gap,
 indicating priority for additional research and policy actions.
 (Kilic et al.,
 2013).
 Given that the objective of the analysis is descriptive rather than causal,
 the detailed decomposition results are interpreted with caution.
 The unexplained component may capture unobserved heterogeneity,
 institutional constraints,
 or social norms not fully observed in the data.
 The econometric findings are complemented by qualitative evidence,
 which helps contextualize gendered differences in agricultural production,
 supporting the interpretation of the decomposition results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further empirical issue concerns the distribution of maize income,
 which exhibits a substantial mass at zero because a sizeable share of households report no maize sales during the reference period.
 As a result,
 the income outcome combines market participation (whether any maize is sold) and sales intensity/earnings conditional on participating.
 This structure can induce strong non-linearities and misspecification in linear models,
 which is consistent with the RESET test indicating specification problems across alternative income regressions.
 Consequently,
 the Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition of maize income should be interpreted with caution,
 as it captures differences in overall income that reflect both the decision to sell maize and the amount earned from sales,
 rather than a single,
 uniform income-generating process.

Qualitative Analytical Approach

\begin_layout Standard
Qualitative data were analyzed using a thematic coding approach aimed at identifying recurring patterns related to gendered constraints in maize production and commercialization.
 Qualitative data were coded using the analysis software package ATLAS.ti,
 which facilitated systematic data organization A coding structure was developed based on the interviews questions and the study’s analytical focus,
 while remaining open to themes emerging during the analysis of the data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final coding structure included themes related to bargaining power,
 decision-making over inputs and income,
 labor allocation,
 market access,
 technology adoption,
 time constraints,
 and gender norms and roles.
 We allowed the overlapping of the codes to reflect the interconnected nature of the themes and particular attention was paid to patterns of co-occurrence across codes.
 The results are presented in section 5.2 and discussed in section 6.
 Selected excerpts were used to illustrate the main themes and support the interpretation of the quantitative results.

OLS estimates of Gender Differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tables 2 and 3 report ordinary least squares (OLS) regression results on the determinants of maize productivity and maize income,
 respectively,
 disaggregated by gender of the household head.
 For each outcome,
 Column (1) reports the raw gender gap estimated from a bivariate regression including only an indicator for male-headed households.
 Column (2) presents results from the full baseline specification controlling for household characteristics,
 access to input markets,
 and plot-level production practices.
 Columns (3) and (4) report gender-specific regressions estimated separately for male- and female-headed households,
 allowing returns to observable characteristics to differ by gender.
 All outcome variables are expressed in inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) units.
 We report household-clustered robust standard errors (clustered at the farmer/household level) to account for heteroskedasticity and correlation of the error term within households across survey rounds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 2 presents regression results for maize productivity measured as yield per acre on the randomly selected plot.Column (1) shows a sizable and statistically significant raw gender gap:
 maize productivity on male-headed plots is approximately 20 percent higher than on female-headed plots.
 Importantly,
 this gap remains statistically significant and of similar magnitude after controlling for a comprehensive set of household- and plot-level characteristics (Column 2),
 indicating that observable endowments explain only a limited share of the productivity differential and pointing instead to differences in returns and unobserved constraints disproportionately affecting female farmers.
 Several plot-level inputs are positively associated with maize productivity.
 Fertilizer use,
 particularly urea and DAP/NPK application,
 and the use of chemical inputs are strongly correlated with higher yields,
 while greater distance to agro-input shops is negatively associated with productivity,
 highlighting the role of spatial access constraints.
 Gender-disaggregated regressions reveal heterogeneity in returns to inputs,
 especially for urea,
 DAP/NPK,
 chemical use and resowing.
 Education of the household head is positively associated with maize productivity among female-headed households,
 while the corresponding effect is small and statistically insignificant among male-headed households,
 suggesting that education may play a more important role in increasing plot-level management among female farmers.
 When pooling observations across survey rounds,
 the estimated gender coefficient remains positive and statistically significant,
 confirming that the productivity gap between male- and female-headed households persists over time,
 even after account for round-fixed effects.
 In particular,
 household size and the age of the household head become consistently and negatively associated with maize productivity,
 when considering the larger sample.
 The use of quality seeds and fertilizer inputs,
 including both DAP/NPK and urea,
 remains strongly and positively associated with productivity,
 and organic manure application also becomes statistically significant in the pooled estimates,
 indicating
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 3 reports analogous results for maize income derived from the randomly selected plot.
 The raw income gap in Column (1) is large and statistically significant,
 with male-headed households earning substantially higher maize income than female-headed households.
 Once controls are introduced (Column 2),
 the estimated gender gap declines but remains economically large and statistically significant,
 indicating that differences in plot size,
 input use,
 and household characteristics explain only part of the observed income disparity.
 Plot size,
 measured in logarithmic terms,
 emerges as a key determinant of maize income,
 reflecting scale effects that operate over and above productivity per acre.
 Input use plays an important role in shaping income outcomes.
 The use of quality seeds,
 fertilizers,
 and chemical inputs is positively associated with maize income in the pooled specification.
 However,
 gender-specific regressions reveal heterogeneity in returns across different inputs.
 While urea application is significantly associated with higher maize income among female-headed households,
 chemical inputs are significant only among male-headed households,
 suggesting that returns to specific inputs differ by gender rather than being uniformly higher for one group.
 As we have noticed with productivity,
 education of the household is positively associated with maize income among female-headed households,
 but not among male-headed households,
 indicating higher returns to human capital for female farmers.
 Household characteristics also matter.
 Household size is negatively associated with income in the pooled specification,
 with a stronger negative effect observed among female-headed households.
 Quality seeds are positively associated with maize income only among male-headed households,
 suggesting that experience and improved inputs translate into higher returns primarily for male farmers.
 Results from the pooled income specification similarly indicate that the gender gap in maize income persists over time,
 with the estimated gender coefficient remaining positive and statistically significant.
 Plot size remains positively and statistically significant in the pooled specification,
 confirming that scale effects continue to play an important role in explaining differences in maize income across households over time.
 Compared with the baseline specification,
 the role of education becomes less pronounced in the pooled sample for female headed households,
 while age significantly become negatively associated with income.
 The pooled estimates reveal that time-varying production decisions play a more prominent role:
 the use of quality seeds,
 fertilizers and chemical inputs remains positively associated with maize income,
 with some coefficients increasing in magnitude relative to the baseline specification.
 In both specifications,
 higher maize productivity is associated with higher income from maize,
 confirming the central role of agricultural performance in determining income.
 However,
 the persistence of a positive and significant gender coefficient after controlling for productivity suggests that income disparities between men and women may be influenced by other factors beyond production,
 such as differences in market access,
 or returns on output.
 Overall,
 the results indicate that while input endowments and plot characteristics contribute to explaining income differences,
 substantial gender disparities persist even after conditioning on observable.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 4 summarizes the factors influencing the adoption of improved maize seed varieties.
 In the raw specification (Column 1),
 male-headed households had a considerably higher likelihood of adoption.
 However,
 the effect disappears when household  and plot-level characteristics are controller for,
 suggesting that the gender differences in adoption are largely explained by unequal access to resources and inputs.
 These results are consistent with previous studies showing that once differences in access to inputs such as land,
 education and inputs are accounted for,
 gender itself foes not significantly affect adoption of improved seeds (Doss,
 2001;
 Horrell & Krishnan,
 2007).
 The use of agricultural inputs,
 particularly DAP/NPK fertilizer,
 urea,
 and chemicals,
 is positively and significantly associated with adoption both at baseline and in the pooled models,
 indicating that hybrid seeds are adopted as part of a broader input use.
 Education also increases the probability of adoption,
 with a stronger effect among female-headed households,
 confirming the findings of Anang (2020).
 There is also a significant association between membership in a farmer group or cooperative and adoption both for female and male headed households.
 Being part of a farmer organization increases the probability of using hybrid seeds,
 likely reflecting improved access to information,
 markets that reduce uncertainty surrounding new technologies.
 As a robustness check,
 we estimate logit models for hybrid seed adoption.
 The results,
 reported in Appendix X,
 are consistent with the linear probability model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although comparing raw and controlled specifications shows the extent to which observable factors contribute to the gender gap,
 this empirical technique does not identify the underlying mechanisms that drive differences between male- and female-headed households.
 The heterogeneous returns observed across the regressions further motivate an explicit decomposition of the income and productivity gaps,
 which we undertake in the following section using the Oaxaca–Blinder framework.

\begin_layout Standard
Given that both maize productivity and maize income are expressed in inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) units,
 the estimated gaps can be interpreted approximately as percentage differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The estimated productivity gap of 0.201 implies that female-headed households exhibit,
 on average,
 about 20% lower maize productivity compared to male-headed households.
 This finding is consistent with De la O’Campos et al.
 (2015),
 who report a difference in mean log productivity between plots managed by male- and female-headed households of 0.177,
 corresponding to a gap of approximately 19.4%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition indicates that only a small fraction of the productivity gap (0.034,
 approximately 17%) is explained by observable differences in endowments,
 such as land size,
 input use,
 and household characteristics.
 The remaining 83% of the gap is attributed to differences in returns to these characteristics,
 suggesting that gender disparities in maize productivity are driven primarily by structural factors,
 differential returns to inputs,
 and gender-specific constraints rather than by unequal access to productive resources alone.
 Through the threefold decomposition,
 the structural component reflects both male structural advantage and female structural disadvantage,
 with the latter accounting for the larger share of the unexplained gap.
 reference to the choice of reference group?
 As highlighted in the literature,
 aggregate decomposition results vary across crops and contexts,
 and the relative contribution of endowment and structural effects depends on how gender is conceptualized—
whether in terms of household heads,
 plot holders,
 or farm managers (De la O’Campos et al.,
 2015).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gender gap in maize income is substantially larger.
 The estimated income gap of 0.975 corresponds to nearly 97% lower maize income among female-headed households relative to male-headed households.
 A sizable share of this gap (0.410,
 approximately 42%) is explained by differences in observable characteristics,
 particularly those related to land size and input use.
 Nevertheless,
 about 58% of the income gap remains unexplained,
 pointing to persistent gender-based inequalities in market access,
 price realization,
 and the ability to translate production into monetary returns.
 Despite comparing male and female plot owners,
 Dandonougbo et al.
 (2023),
 found that the average farm income gap can be explained by 58.5% in structural advantages of male farmers in Togo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The detailed decomposition provides additional insight into which specific covariates contribute most to the explained and unexplained components of the gap.
 In the case of maize productivity,
 differences in land endowments and education appear among the most relevant contributors to the explained component,
 although their quantitative contribution remains modest relative to the total gap.
 Importantly,
 input use exhibit substantial contributions within the structural component.
 This pattern suggests that even when female-headed households have access to similar observable inputs,
 the returns associated with these inputs differ across groups.
 For maize income,
 the detailed results indicate that land size (log area) is a major contributor to the explained component,
 confirming that scale remains an important determinant of income disparities.
 However,
 a considerable portion of the income gap remains located in the structural component across multiple covariates,
 reinforcing the interpretation that differences in returns drive income inequality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These detailed results should be interpreted as descriptive accounting exercises.
 Given the maintained assumptions of additive linearity,
 overlapping support,
 and ignorability,
 the contribution of individual covariates reflects their role within the specified linear model and reference structure,
 rather than isolated structural parameters.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results are organized around four analytical areas which correspond to the main mechanisms that contribute to the gender gaps observed in the quantitative analysis:
 
\series bold
Gender norms,
 labour division and time poverty:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Across all focus groups,
 gender norms emerged as a key determinant of labour allocation and time use among maize farmers.
 Both female and male participants consistently described a fixed and rigid division of labour,
 with farming roles framed as natural and socially prescribed.
 As one participant stated,
 “the roles of men are men’s and the ones for women are women’s” (KAWETE,
 male).
 Male participants in particular described women as physically weaker and only suitable for lighter agricultural activities,
 such as planting,
 weeding,
 harvesting,
 while agricultural tasks requiring physical strength or technical judgment,
 like slashing and spraying,
 were explicitly associated with men:
 “Women are weak and can only manage weeding while the man can do everything” (BULUMWAKI,
 male),
 and “the ones that require energy like preparations,
 slashing,
 removing the maize wastes (\SpecialChar ldots
) even the ones that need thinking” (WAMULONGO,
 male).
 However,
 some female participants challenged this narrative emphasizing substantial changes over time.
 Particularly in female focus groups,
 women repeatedly stressed that they now take care a wide range of agricultural activities traditionally associated with men.
 As one participant explained,
 “Nowadays even the women prepare land,
 burn grass and even slash” (MAWERERE,
 female),
 while another added “what a man can do even the woman can do” (MUGGI,
 mixed).
 Across focus groups,
 women were widely associated with childcare and domestic responsibilities,
 often working alongside children in the fields.
 As one female participant noted,
 “I and the children are the ones who work most because since we are done with his garden then he has not time at all to step on the joint garden (\SpecialChar ldots
) He returns in the night when you are done working” (BUKAYE,
 female,
 but maybe choose ancother one).
 Women’s agricultural labour remains closely tied to caregiving roles,
 even as they increasingly take on tasks previously considered male and rather then replacing existing domestic responsabilities,
 it was added on top of them,
 leading to widespread time poverty and limiting agricultural productivity.
 Women described delayed arrival to maize plots,
 shorter working hours,
 and early departure due to household obligations.
 These qualitative insights suggest that social constrains women's time and labour division contribute to gender gaps in maize productivity and income,
 especially in female-headed household,
 where husbands are generally abstent less involved in daily farming and household activities.
 Despite this heavy workload,
 women repeatedly portrayed these tasks as unavoidable,
 framing them as natural and inherent to being a woman.
 As one participant explained,
 “God prepared us as women that you cannot leave home without sweeping the house,
 have not cleaned the compound and the kitchen” (BUDHUBYE,
 female).
 Similarly,
 women across different focus groups emphasized the inevitability of these roles:
 “I see they do affect me but still I have no choice” (MUGGI,
 mixed),
 and “those roles are naturally mine and I have to do them whether I want to or do not want to” (MUGGI,
 mixed).
 While some men,
 particularly in mixed focus groups,
 acknowledged domestic work as labour,
 others framed household and childcare responsibilities as a way for women to avoid agricultural work.
 Male focus groups highlighted their own productivity in the fields while portraying women’s care activities as avoidable disruptions:
 “they want us to have equal share of things but they are lazy (\SpecialChar ldots
) and tend to cheat us in that way,
 you may be digging the fourth or fifth row and yet she will do only three rows and say she is heading back home,
 I am going to prepare home” (ITANDA,
 mixed).
 These perceptions were directly linked to agricultural outcomes,
 with participants concluding that “This leads to poor farm management and low yields” (ITANDA,
 mixed).
 Consistent with this framing,
 male participants often interpreted women’s childcare responsibilities,
 such as breastfeeding,
 not as binding constraints but as excuses for rest or reduced effort.
 As one man put it,
 “When she holds the baby she will be using it as an excuse to sit (\SpecialChar ldots
) It helps her to just sit there and rest” (WAMULONGO,
 male).
 In more than one interviews with just female we noticed that women’s time constraints extend beyond agricultural and domestic labour to include expectations of sexual availability,
 revealing how gender norms structure both productive work and bodily autonomy:
 “By the time you leave the garden then you cook and then bath the children and then you find that you leave the garden when you are tired and eat supper while tired and then go to bed when you are tired and then the man will start saying that I want to have sex.” (BUKAYE,
 female);
 (When taken together,
 these dynamics point to unobserved constraints on women's time and bodily autonomy that shape their productive capacity,
 helping in understanding underlying mechanism explaining gender gaps in maize productivity and income that standard quantitative measures do not capture).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
decision making
\series default
:
 From the discussions it came out that gendered norms are also likely to assign rights over inputs and output independently of effort.
 Across focus groups,
 decision-making over agricultural inputs and income from maize varied across plot types,
 between women-managed plots,
 jointly managed plots,
 and male-owned plots,
 reflecting gendered power relations within households.
 In male-owned plots,
 women’s contribution rarely translated into decision-making power and usually it's the man that decides on inputs,
 sometimes after a joint discussion.
 In women-managed plots,
 women were generally described as having more autonomy over input decisions,
 including maize variety and fertilizer use.
 However,
 some male participants suggested that men retain decision-making authority even over women’s plots,
 often referring to the saying “omwami kyakobye” (“what the man says”).
 In jointly managed plots,
 decisions over inputs were more frequently described as either jointly discussed or male-led,
 with men often making the final decision.
 Income decisions followed similar patterns.
 Female focus groups stressed that men retain control over harvests despite limited labor contribution.
 (a sentence about male owned).
 In jointly managed plots,
 income from maize sales was often described as discussed within the household,
 yet men frequently had the final say.
 As one participant stated:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My husband is the one who decides because there is no way you can decide for him though.
 It is not by law that he decides but it depends on how you relate and the togetherness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

(BUDHUBYE,
 female).
 Along similar lines,
 some male participants stated that:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The household decisions are not made by a woman because it becomes a dead household
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 reflecting strict norms about male authority over income.
 In contrast,
 women more often reported control over income generated from plots they managed independently but as one participant said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Men are not easy,
 they tend to come to you and influence you with good behavior until you give them the money
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

(village,
 female).
 Women’s control over maize income is sometimes justified through gendered moral narratives that frame women as more responsible household managers than men.
 They usually decide to have their own garden to be sure to have control over it and use the money for the family as decisions related to children’s expenses were consistently framed as women’s responsibility.
 Describing her garden a female participant claim that:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

with that I have the right to decide on my own and that since I have sold this maize let me give this to a certain child and also buy something for the household and for myself because you know as women we do not behave like the men that when they receive they go and get more wives.
 For us we prepare for the household well-being
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.(BUDHUBYE,
 female).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
maybe add:
 R2:
 These women are a bit lazy in doing research especially about the farming business they tend to lag behind a bit so in my household I decided and I am the one who decides the maize seed type that I will plant.
 So they are lazy seeds in this and if you trust their ideas,
 she might even make you plant soya instead ( WAMULONGO,
 male)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Technology adoption and community perception 
\series default
:
 Participants described the adoption of new technologies,
 such as hybrid seeds or fertilizers,
 as generating both admiration and suspicion in the community.
 While some people are recognized and respected for their productivity outcomes,
 others were viewed as envious and their success was often solely attributed to supernatural means.
 Throughout all focus groups,
 witchcraft was mentioned regularly when discussing individuals who achieved higher yields.
 As one participant explained,
 “we start to say that one is a ‘mukuluzi’—
the one who pulls all other people’s yields to his or her own garden” (BUDHUBYE,
 female),
 while another added that “they say the woman uses witchcraft to collect all the maize from the neighbor’s gardens” (NALWEGOLOILE,
 mixed).
 In particular,
 female headed households were sometimes portrayed as violating accepted gender roles when adopting new technology.
 As participants reported,
 “they say that woman is unmanageable,
 she is a woman who is a man” (BULUMWAKI,
 male),
 and “she is the one wearing the trouser,
 the man is wearing the skirt” (ITANDA,
 mixed).
 In female-only discussions,
 women underlined that economic success may lead to social scrutiny for women,
 as the village members could often question whether a woman who earned substantial income through farming would remain manageable within the household (BUKAYE,
 female).
 Overall,
 social reputation and community moral judgment serve as informal constraints on technology adoption for both women and men,
 resulting in uneven diffusion across households.
 These narratives imply that technology adoption is viewed as a practice grounded in community norms,
 rather than a neutral technical choice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Market
\series default
:
 Across focus groups,
 participants described a non-neutral market with unequal access,
 price-setting practices,
 and with women facing a higher risk of being cheated by maize buyers,
 even though some respondents reported that prices can be equal for men and women under certain conditions.Both men and women claimed that traders frequently abuse information asymmetries,
 especially when interacting with women,
 who are regarded to be less knowledgeable about current market values.
 As one participant noted,
 “there is a difference as women are cheated because they think women are not knowledgeable” (Bubeto,
 male).
 Others linked this directly to mobility and access to information,
 stressing that men are believed to be more informed because “men listen to the radios and get latest price updates” (Kigulamo,
 mixed male).
 Price discrimination was described not only in terms of lower offered prices,
 but through manipulation of weighing scales.
 Participants reported that similar maize bags could be weighed differently depending on the seller’s gender,
 resulting in systematic losses for women.
 Consequently,
 some men explicitly stated that women should not sell maize independently to avoid being cheated,
 as illustrated by one participant who explained,
 “my wife does not sell without me being around because I don’t want her to be cheated” (Bulumwaki,
 male).
 These market dynamics may lead to structural income discrepancies between female and male-headed families,
 as maize sales in female-headed homes are inevitably handled by women,
 who are thus more vulnerable to gendered forms of price discrimination.
 In these circumstances,
 collective marketing via farming organizations and cooperatives was widely regarded as a technique for decreasing price discrimination and fraud.
 While some participants were wary about cooperatives,
 others emphasized that selling collectively allowed women and men to reach the same consumers,
 reducing knowledge gaps and limiting opportunistic behavior.
 As one participant explained,
 “that is why you see we want to all join groups,
 in a group\SpecialChar ldots
 they give you the same price—
the man and I the woman” (BUKAYE,
 female).
