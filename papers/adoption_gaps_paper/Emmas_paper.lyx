\begin_layout Abstract
This study investigates the gender gaps in maize productivity from maize in Eastern Uganda,
 focusing on male- and female-headed households in the Busoga region.
 Using mixed-methods approach,
 the analysis combines quantitative and qualitative evidence.
 First,
 Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions are employed to estimate gender differences in maize productivity and income.
 Second,
 a Oaxaca- Blinder decomposition is applied to disentangle the extent to which these gaps are explained by differences in observable characteristics and endowments versus structural factors.
 Qualitative analysis and Focus Group Discussions complement the econometric analysis by providing a contextual understanding of gendered dynamics in maize production.
 The study contributes to the literature by providing new evidence on gender-differentiated productivity and income outcomes in smallholder maize farming and by identifying the key drivers of possible disparities.
 The findings offer policy-relevant insights for promoting equitable maize productivity and income in agricultural production in Eastern Uganda.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agriculture is the backbone of many sub-Saharan African economies,
 contributing a large share of both output and employment.
 In Uganda the population is predominantly rural (72%) and it substantially relies on agriculture (Uganda Bureau of Statistics [UBOS],
 2014) employing a high share of women laborers,
 which constitute (from notes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increasing the agricultural output of both male and female farmers is essential to the nation's current problems of feeding a growing population and dealing with the dangers of climate change.
 This is the reason why increasing agricultural production and productivity is one of the goals of Uganda's Agriculture Sector Development Strategy and Investment Plan (DSIP),
 which aims to improve food security and nutrition for all Ugandans and raise the incomes of rural households.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paper focuses on the cultivation of maize,
 one of the most important crops in Ugandan agriculture.
 Maize is a central staple crop in Uganda,
 (together with matoke,
 cassava and beans) and is cultivated by the majority of rural households in East Africa,
 making the Ugandan experience broadly comparable to that of other African countries (Sell et al.,
 2018).
 Previous research suggests that climate change is expected to have a significant negative effect on maize production in Uganda,
 with projected yield losses of around 5% by 2050 relative to levels observed in 2000 (Kikoyo & Norbert,
 2016).
 In an agricultural context with multiple constraints and challenges it is important to use resources as efficiently as possible.
 For the majority of small-scale farmers,
 increasing yields through the expansion of cultivated land is not feasible and enhancing productivity is one of the few feasible alternatives (Sell et.
 all,
 2018).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this context,
 identifying strategies to enhance agricultural production,
 and consequently income,
 becomes essential for GDP growth,
 poverty reduction,
 food security,
 and structural transformation.
 Despite that,
 progress has remained stubbornly slow,
 with productivity growth lagging well behind other regions (e.g.,
 Suri & Udry,
 2022).
 One of the most persistent and costly inefficiencies is the gender gap in agricultural productivity and income (Buehren,
 2023).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large body of literature shows that women in agriculture face persistent structural and institutional constraints,
 including limited access to land,
 credit,
 labor,
 inputs,
 information,
 and markets,
 as well as time constraints linked to household and caregiving responsibilities,
 that prevent them from achieving productivity levels comparable to those of men (source?).
 Another key constraint on agricultural productivity is the widespread under-adoption of modern agricultural technologies,
 such as improved seeds and fertilizers(source).
 Despite decades of investments,
 uptake remains well below potential,
 as outlined in a recent review by Suri and Udry (2022).
 Crucially,
 even when women adopt improved technologies,
 their productivity and gains are often smaller.
 This reflects persistent disadvantages in access to complementary resources such as land quality,
 labor,
 and market opportunities that further erode potential gains.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gender disparities in agricultural productivity and income are costly and they represent a lost chance to increase national income and alleviate poverty (world bank report).
 The first objective of this paper is to contribute to the bulk of evidence on gender differentials in agricultural productivity by analyzing context-specific data from Busoga region in Uganda using OLS regression and decomposition techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The findings of this study makes a policy-relevant knowledge contribution to understanding gender-based differences in farm productivity and income from maize.
 Understanding and addressing these gender-differentiated constraints is essential for achieving inclusive agricultural transformation and realizing the full benefits of modern innovations,
 as well as for improving well-being and food security.

\begin_layout Section
Research Questions and Literature Review (and Theoretical Framework)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
RQ1:
 To what extent do gender gaps exist in the adoption of agricultural productivity and farm income?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
RQ2:
 What is the relative importance of endowment versus structural effects to the gender gap in agricultural technology adoption and productivity?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While women constitute a substantial share of the agricultural labor force in Sub-Saharan Africa – over 50% Tanzania and Uganda;
 29% in Ethiopia (Palacios-Lopez et al.,
 2017) – they consistently achieve lower yields than men and the income they get is substantially lower than the one earned by male farmers (FAO,
 2011).
 In 2014,
 estimated gender productivity gaps ranged from 6% in Tanzania to 25% in Malawi (O’Sullivan et al.,
 2014).
 More recent estimates indicate a gap of 11% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (World Bank,
 2021),
 30% in Nigeria (World Bank,
 2022) and X in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper contributes to the literature on gender gaps in the agricultural sector (incl.
 De,
 Miehe,
 and Van Campenhout,
 2024).
 Building on the intra-household approach,
 after estimating the gap through simple OLS regressions,
 we advance the literature that disentangles the roles of endowment versus structural effects in driving gender disparities.
 Women face two broad types of constraints:
 limited access to assets and productive inputs (endowment effect) and discriminatory social norms and practices that reduce returns to those inputs (structural effect).
 The most common approach to analyzing such gaps is the Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition of mean differences (Oaxaca,
 1973),
 a method widely used in labor economics.
 Kilic,
 Palacios-Lopez,
 and Goldstein (2015) were the first to apply this approach to the analysis of agricultural productivity.
 Building on this framework,
 we employ the Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition to examine gender gaps in both agricultural productivity and farming gross income.
 The estimation strategy is described in detail in Section X.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The existing literature indicates that both mechanisms play a role in shaping the observed gaps in agricultural productivity and income (World Bank report).
 With respect to the productivity gap,
 multiple studies show that once differences in access to productive inputs are accounted for,
 the estimated gap substantially narrow (Gilbert et al.,
 2002 in Malawi;
 Kinkingninhoun-Mêdagbé et al.,
 2010 in Benin;
 Kilic et al.,
 2015 in Malawi;
 Peterman et al.,
 2011 in Uganda and Nigeria),
 highlighting the key importance of access to inputs in observed yields differentials.
 For example,
 De la O Campos et al.
 (2016) demonstrate that the gender gap in agricultural productivity in Uganda diminishes once differences in access to production factors—
such as fertilizers and pesticides—
as well as crop choice are taken into account.
 In this regard,
 also Kilic et al.
 suggest that disparities in asset ownership,
 such as machinery and new technology,
 substantially contribute to the gender gap in productivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 other studies find that productivity gaps persist even after equalizing input access,
 pointing to structural constraints,
 resource allocation and returns to inputs as the main problems (Ali et al.,
 2016 in Uganda;
 Bello et al.,
 2021 in Nigeria;
 O’Sullivan et al.,
 2014 in Malawi,
 Niger,
 Uganda,
 Tanzania,
 and northern Nigeria;
 Kinkingninhoun-Medagb´e et al.,
 2010 in Benin).
 Compared to men,
 female farmers typically oversee smaller farms on lower-quality land and have weaker land tenure rights.
 According to Ali et.
 al (2015) women’s plots in Uganda are 36% smaller than men’s ones and they show less quality.
 This is usually explained by discriminatory traditional laws that exclude women and favor men in ownership rights and land allocation (World bank report).
 Several studies have shown that child dependency ratio,
 social expectation and time poverty play a key role in shaping these differences (Ali et al.,
 2016;Pierotti et al.,
 2022;
 Donald et al.,
 2023;
 Sell et al.,
 2018).
 According to Sell et al.,
 women’s lower level of productivity is negatively associated with the number of household members.
 Time constraints may be more binding for women as a great proportion of their time is devoted to mansions that do not generate an income,
 such as childcare,
 elderly care and food preparation and prevent them from engaging in agricultural activities (world bank report and Pierotti et al).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evidence from the literature also suggests that social norms and expectations in market orientation and risk preferences could explain the gender gap in productivity (Ali et al,
 2016;
 Duflo & Udry,
 2004;
 Sell et al.,
 2018;
 Reynolds et al.,
 2020).
 Evidence shows that women placed lower value on cash crops,
 overlooking income potential and high market prices,
 while favoring food security (Duflo,
 Udry,
 2004).
 Other factors that might explain the gender gap in productivity and income from maize are access to labour and credit market (Kilic,
 Palacios-Lopez & Goldstein,
 2015;
 Palacios-Lopez & Lopez,
 2015;
 Ali et al.,
 2016;).
 Palacios-Lopez and Lopez claim that correcting market failures could positively impact female farmers’ productivity.
 Several studies identify discrimination in the labor market and off-farm work as drivers of low labor productivity in plots managed by female-headed households (Palacios-Lopez ´ and Lopez ´ (2015),
 Julien et al.,2023).
 Limited access to finance further constrains women’s ability to adopt modern technologies,
 machinery,
 and improved agricultural practices,
 reinforcing existing productivity and income disparities (World Bank).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although these contributions provide a meaningful overview of the context,
 context-specific analysis is required to effectively guide policy recommendations.
 We extend this body of work by estimating gender gaps in agricultural productivity and income from maize in male and female headed households using plot-level data from the Busoga region of Uganda for 2021–2022.
 Gender gap in agricultural productivity,
 particularly in maize production,
 usually translates into a gender gap in income,
 as documented by the World Bank,
 thereby reinforcing processes of feminization of poverty.
 However,
 while gender disparities in agricultural productivity have been extensively studied,
 evidence on gendered income differentials from farming in Africa remains limited and fragmented (Eliaza et al.,
 2023,
 check it) .
 This paper contributes to addressing this gap by building on the existing literature on gender gaps in agricultural productivity and by expanding the analysis to include gross income disparities from farming.

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantitative Data and Descriptive Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use panel data from three survey rounds with approximately 3,500 smallholder maize farmers in southeastern Uganda.
 The data were originally collected for a project focused on agro-dealers and their customers.
 The agro-dealer sample was constructed by listing all agro-dealers operating across eleven districts in the Busoga region,
 an area characterized by smallholder maize production,
 where maize serves both as a staple food and a cash crop.
 To link agro-dealers with farmers,
 each agro-dealer was asked to identify the villages where most of their customers reside.
 Enumerators then randomly sampled ten maize-growing households from each of these villages,
 yielding the sample of 3,470 farmers.
 This sampling frame allows us to assume that sampled farmers have reasonable access to improved maize varieties,
 should they choose to adopt them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enumerators interviewed the household member most knowledgeable about maize cultivation.
 A subset of questions specifically targeted the household head,
 who may or may not have been the respondent.
 In addition to general information on agricultural practices,
 farmers were asked to list all their maize plots,
 from which one was randomly selected for detailed data collection.
 This approach minimized survey duration and respondent burden while preserving representativeness at the household level,
 due to the random selection of plots.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Measurement of key variable and Gender Indicator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- Outcome/Dependent Variables :
 The analysis focuses on two main outcome variables:
 agricultural productivity and income from maize.
 Agricultural productivity is measured as maize yield per unit of cultivated land,
 capturing differences in output across plots.
 Income from maize is calculated as the gross value of maize sales,
 defined as the quantity of maize sold multiplied by the unit price received.
 This measure captures monetary returns from maize production and includes households that did not sell maize,
 for whom income is recorded as zero.
 Given the skewed distribution of income and the presence of zero values,
 maize productivity and income are transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformation in the empirical analysis.
 .
 Skewness is according to the adjusted Fisher-Pearson coefficient of skewness exceeding 1.96.
 To address the recent critiques by Mullahy and Norton (2022) and Chen and Roth (2024),
 we will apply the IHS transformation cautiously when dealing with outcome variables that have many zeros and impacts on the extensive margin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- Gender Indicator:
 the assessment of gender gaps in agriculture generally relies on two empirical approaches and indicators.
 This choice significantly influences the analysis of gender differences (De la O Campos,
 year).
 The first one is the one this paper uses and consists of inter-household analyses,
 which compare agricultural production in female- and male-headed households,
 using household headship as a proxy for plot management.
 The second approach adopts an intra-household perspective,
 comparing production on female- and male-managed plots within the same household.
 As mentioned by Ali et al.
 (2016),
 inter-household analyses rely on household headship as a proxy for plot management and,
 since most female-managed plots are located within male-headed households,
 may draw inferences from a non-representative subset of women farmers and misclassify plots by gender.
 Intra-household approaches compare female- and male-managed plots within the same household,
 allowing household characteristics to be held constant,
 though they require more detailed data and may face limitations in sample size and external validity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover,
 differences between de jure and de facto female-headed households suggest that household headship is an imperfect proxy for gender in agriculture (explain it!!) (Peterman et al.,
 2010;
 de la O Campos,
 2023).
 The use of household headship is further problematic because it does not capture who makes agricultural decisions or controls productive assets,
 nor does it account for intra-household power dynamics that shape resource allocation (Doss,
 2001;
 Udry,
 1996;
 Quisumbing & Maluccio,
 2003).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study,
 the use of an inter-household approach is driven by data availability,
 as gender information was collected at the level of the household head,
 making intra-household quantitative analysis infeasible.
 Nevertheless,
 this limitation is partly addressed through qualitative data,
 which provide insights into intra-household decision-making processes and power relations and complement the inter-household quantitative analysis.
 The quantitative results are presented in Section X.Building on this framework,
 the analysis employs an OLS specification combined with an Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition to disentangle the relative contributions of differences in endowments and returns to the observed gender gaps in agricultural productivity and farm income.

Qualitative Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The qualitative component was conducted in Busoga region (eastern Uganda),
 in several villages in the districts of Iganga,
 Bugweri,
 Bugiri,
 and Mayuge,
 over a period of approximately 15 days (two weeks) between November and December 2025.
 Sixteen focus group discussions (FGDs) were held,
 each with 10 participants (160 participants in total).
 The composition of the groups was defined to capture specific gender perspectives,
 therefore 5 FGDs were women-only,
 5 were men-only,
 and 6 were mixed.
 The single-gender groups were used to encourage the participants to freely express experiences and opinions by reducing possible effects of bias and power asymmetries that can arise in mixed contexts.
 On the other hand,
 mixed groups allowed us to observe how intra-family norms and roles are reproduced in the discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants were selected randomly,
 ensuring a range of ages (all adults).
 All of them were plot managers but not necessarily the household head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discussions were guided by a semi-structured outline consisting mainly of open-ended questions,
 probes and follow-ups.
 Moreover,
 participants were prompted to reflect on concrete examples and real-life situations in order to encourage/foster an open and participatory discussion.
 The questions (provided in Appendix X) covered topics related to division of labor,
 economic empowerment,
 decision-making processes,
 and intra-household power dynamics.
 All FGDs were conducted in Lusoga language by two enumerators and lasted an average of about two hours.
 In all of them it was ensured privacy and confidentiality;
 in particular,
 women and male partners/counterparts were not involved in the same session as this could compromise safety or freedom of expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The qualitative work aimed to contextualize the quantitative results and explore underlying social mechanisms.

Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At baseline,
 we asked for the gender of the household head (though it is likely that the gender of the respondent was recorded instead).
 At midline,
 no gender information was collected,
 but it is unlikely to have changed since baseline.
 At endline,
 we recorded both the gender of the household head and the gender of the respondent (as I became concerned about this issue between midline and endline and added a question).
 While this allows for inter-household analyses,
 we do not always have the gender of the farmer managing the randomly selected plot for which we have data.
 Furthermore,
 most farming takes place on plots jointly managed by men and women.
 These limitations represent a weakness of the study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We have relatively few female-headed households,
 which limits statistical power.
 At baseline,
 we supposedly recorded the gender of the household head,
 identifying 774 female-headed households (22% of 3,470 farmers).
 At endline,
 we recorded 760 female respondents (23% of 3,299).
 While we also collected household head gender at endline,
 2,848 observations are missing,
 suggesting that enumerators may have consistently recorded the gender of the respondent rather than the household head—
likely at baseline as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We have multiple measures of adoption,
 including self-reported use of improved seed on any plot,
 use of seed from an agro-shop on any plot,
 hybrid seed or OPV on a specific plot,
 and use of seed from an agro-shop on a specific plot.
 We should carefully consider which measure to use.

\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantitative Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis focuses on two main outcome variables:
 maize productivity and maize sales revenue.
 Maize productivity is measured as yield per acre from a randomly chosen plot,
 which captures differences in output per unit of cultivated land between households.
 Maize income is calculated as the gross value of maize sales from the same plot,
 which is the number of maize bags sold multiplied by the price received per bag.
 This definition also includes all the households that chose to not sell maize,
 for whom income is recorded as zero.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the highly skewed distribution of both outcomes and the presence of zero values,
 the analysis employs the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformation of maize productivity and income.
 This transformation retains observations with zero outcomes while approximating logarithmic transformations for larger values.
 
\end_layout

Gender gaps in maize productivity and income are first estimated using an ordinary least squares (OLS) framework.
 The baseline specification relates to a simple yield function (Udry,
 1996)(Kilik) in the form:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{ht}=\alpha+\beta G_{h}+\gamma'X_{ij}+\delta Y_{0ij}+\varepsilon_{ij}\label{eq:one-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
equation1 :IHS(Yht)=α+βGh+Xhγ+εh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where Yh\SpecialChar allowbreak
 denotes the outcome of interest for household h,
 measured alternatively as maize productivity or income from maize.
 While previous studies model productivity outcomes in logarithmic form (e.g.
 Udry,
 1996),
 we employ the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation to accommodate zero productivity and income observations.
 Gh\SpecialChar allowbreak
 is a binary indicator equal to one if the household head is male and zero otherwise.
 The coefficient β therefore captures the average difference in outcomes between male and female headed households,
 conditional on observable characteristics.
 The vector X\SpecialChar allowbreak
 includes a set of control variables commonly used in the literature on gender gaps in agricultural outcomes (López,
 1984;
 López,
 1986;
 Peterman et al.,
 2011).
 These controls account for differences in household socio-economic characteristics,
 farm size and input use,
 labor availability,
 and access to markets and agricultural services.
 Due to data limitations,
 the analysis does not include detailed agro-climatic or soil quality indicators,
 such as rainfall variability or irrigation intensity,
 which may also affect agricultural outcomes.
 The error term εh captures unobserved factors affecting agricultural outcomes.
 The full set of covariates and the corresponding regression specifications are reported in Tables 2 and 3 in the Results section.
 Some variables reported in the descriptive statistics are excluded from the regression analysis either because they are highly collinear with included covariates or because they could create problems of endogeneity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate the sources of gender disparities in adoption,
 productivity,
 and income,
 we will apply the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (Blinder,
 1973;
 Oaxaca,
 1973).
 The OLS regressions described provide the basis for the decomposition methods.
 This method decomposes observed gender gaps into two components:
 the endowment effect and the structural effect.
 The endowment effect captures differences due to observable farmer and farm-household characteristics,
 such as access to land,
 credit,
 education,
 and inputs.
 These are factors that reflect unequal resource access.
 The structural effect accounts for differences in returns to those resources,
 potentially reflecting discriminatory social norms or practices.
 The Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition therefore quantifies the contribution of observable characteristics commonly available in household survey data while acknowledging that unobserved data not computed in the equation,
 such as agro-ecological conditions may remain captured in the returns component (source).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the work of Kilic et al.
 (2015),
 we derived the average gap between men and women "D",
 expressed as the average difference in productivity and income.
 The gender productivity gap,
 D,
 can be expressed as the difference in average outcomes between groups based on the linear estimation of agricultural productivity (ihs) and income (ihs)using equation (1,
 OLS):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
equation 2:
 D=E(Ym) - E(Yf)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under equation (1),
 the expected outcome for male-headed households ( 𝐺 ℎ = 1 ) and female-headed households ( 𝐺 ℎ = 0 ) can be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
equation 3 and equation 4:
 E(Y M ​)= E(Yf)=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 this specification makes the restrictive assumption that the returns to observable characteristics are the same for male and female-headed households.
 To relax this assumption,
 we follow standard practice (Kilic) and estimate separate linear regressions for each gender.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
equation 5 and 6:
 Ym = Yf= 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
that can be combined into equation 7:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By substituting these expressions into the definition of D,
 the overall gender gap can be expressed as a function of disparities in observable characteristics as well as differences in the returns to those characteristics.
 To obtain an aggregate decomposition,
 we follow the twofold Oaxaca–Blinder approach and use the coefficients from the pooled regression as the reference structure (Jann,
 2008).
 The resulting decomposition can be written as:
 equation 7
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The explained component captures the portion of the gender gap attributable to differences in observable endowments,
 such as land,
 fertilizer use and access to inputs.
 The unexplained component reflects differences in returns to the endowmnets as well as the influence of unobserved factors,
 and is often interpreted as capturing structural constraints.
 All outcomes are expressed in inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) units,
 which allows coefficients and gaps to be interpreted approximately as percentage differences and are presented in table 4.

OLS results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tables 2 and 3 report ordinary least squares (OLS) regression results on the determinants of maize productivity and maize income,
 respectively,
 disaggregated by gender of the household head.
 For each outcome,
 Column (1) reports the raw gender gap estimated from a bivariate regression including only an indicator for male-headed households.
 Column (2) presents results from the full baseline specification controlling for household characteristics,
 access to input markets,
 and plot-level production practices.
 Columns (3) and (4) report gender-specific regressions estimated separately for male- and female-headed households,
 allowing returns to observable characteristics to differ by gender.
 All outcome variables are expressed in inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) units.
 Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (HC3) are reported in parentheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 2 presents regression results for maize productivity measured as yield per acre on the randomly selected plot.Column (1) shows a sizable and statistically significant raw gender gap:
 maize productivity on male-headed plots is approximately 20 percent higher than on female-headed plots.
 Importantly,
 this gap remains statistically significant and of similar magnitude after controlling for a comprehensive set of household- and plot-level characteristics (Column 2),
 indicating that observable endowments explain only a limited share of the productivity differential and pointing instead to differences in returns and unobserved constraints disproportionately affecting female farmers.
 Several plot-level inputs are positively associated with maize productivity.
 Fertilizer use,
 particularly urea and DAP/NPK application,
 and the use of chemical inputs are strongly correlated with higher yields,
 while greater distance to agro-input shops is negatively associated with productivity,
 highlighting the role of spatial access constraints.
 Gender-disaggregated regressions reveal heterogeneity in returns to inputs,
 especially for urea,
 DAP/NPK,
 chemical use and resowing.
 Education of the household head is positively associated with maize productivity among female-headed households,
 while the corresponding effect is small and statistically insignificant among male-headed households,
 suggesting that education may play a more important role in increasing plot-level management among female farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 3 reports analogous results for maize income derived from the randomly selected plot.
 The raw income gap in Column (1) is large and statistically significant,
 with male-headed households earning substantially higher maize income than female-headed households.
 Once controls are introduced (Column 2),
 the estimated gender gap declines but remains economically large and statistically significant,
 indicating that differences in plot size,
 input use,
 and household characteristics explain only part of the observed income disparity.
 Plot size,
 measured in logarithmic terms,
 emerges as a key determinant of maize income,
 reflecting scale effects that operate over and above productivity per acre.
 Input use plays an important role in shaping income outcomes.
 The use of quality seeds,
 fertilizers,
 and chemical inputs is positively associated with maize income in the pooled specification.
 However,
 gender-specific regressions reveal heterogeneity in returns across different inputs.
 While urea application is significantly associated with higher maize income among female-headed households,
 chemical inputs are significant only among male-headed households,
 suggesting that returns to specific inputs differ by gender rather than being uniformly higher for one group.
 As we have noticed with productivity,
 education of the household is positively associated with maize income among female-headed households,
 but not among male-headed households,
 indicating higher returns to human capital for female farmers.
 Household characteristics also matter.
 Household size is negatively associated with income in the pooled specification,
 with a stronger negative effect observed among female-headed households.
 Age of the household head and the use of quality seeds are positively associated with maize income only among male-headed households,
 suggesting that experience and improved inputs translate into higher returns primarily for male farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taken together,
 the results indicate that while input endowments and plot characteristics contribute to explaining income differences,
 substantial gender disparities persist even after conditioning on observables.
 The heterogeneous returns observed across gender-specific regressions further motivate an explicit decomposition of the income and productivity gaps,
 which we undertake in the following section using the Oaxaca–Blinder framework.

\begin_layout Standard
Given that both maize productivity and maize income are expressed in inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) units,
 the estimated gaps can be interpreted approximately as percentage differences.
 The productivity gap of −0.187 corresponds to roughly a 19% lower productivity among female-headed households.
 This confirms the findings of De la O’ Campos et al.
 (2015) that found a difference in mean log productivity between plots of male- and female-headed households of 0.177,
 equivalent to 19.4%.
 Our results show that only a small share of this gap (−0.017,
 approximately 9%) is explained by observable differences in endowments such as land size,
 input use,
 and household characteristics,
 while the vast majority (−0.170,
 about 91%) remains unexplained.
 This suggests that gender disparities in maize productivity are driven primarily by structural factors,
 differential returns to inputs,
 and gender-specific constraints rather than by unequal ownership of productive resources alone.
 The aggregate decomposition values do vary from one crop and context to another (world bank) and the relative contribution of endowment and structural effects in explaining the gender gap varies according to how the gender variable is conceptualized (heads,
 holders,
 or managers) (De la O’Campos et al.,
 2015).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The income gap is substantially larger.
 The estimated gap of −0.951 corresponds to an approximate 60% lower maize income among female headed households relative to male-headed households.
 A large share of the income gap (−0.324,
 around 34%) is explained by observable characteristics.
 Nevertheless,
 the majority of the gap (−0.627,
 approximately 66%) remains unexplained,
 pointing to persistent gender-based inequalities in market access,
 price realization,
 and economic returns.

Discussion and Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the substantial benefits of modern agricultural technologies,
 this study addresses a high-impact research area.
 While both men and women face adoption challenges,
 our focus is on understanding constraints specific to female farmers.
 The project will generate actionable evidence to enhance technology uptake among female smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa,
 a critical step toward building resilience in a vulnerable population.
